# MinimalSwayFX

Minimal configuration for [swayFX](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx), a great tiling wayland window manager.
It's made so people don't waste there time creating there own configs. That may take hours.
It's a minimal config so you might add new features on top of it. If you like, than you shall add a pull 
request for your config too.
